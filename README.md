# Fraud_Detection
Identifying fradulent transactions in a dataset using different machine learning models 
Fraud Detection System

A machine learning-based fraud detection system designed to identify fraudulent transactions using various classification algorithms.

📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using supervised learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

🚀 Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes transaction patterns and fraud distribution.

Machine Learning Models: Implements multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Model Evaluation: Uses metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Feature Importance: Identifies key indicators of fraud.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains transaction details with labels indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

Dataset Structure
Features:

Transaction amount, time, location, etc.

Derived features (if applicable).

Target Variable: Binary label (0 for legitimate, 1 for fraudulent).

(Note: If the dataset is publicly available, mention the source. If it's private, specify how to obtain access.)
