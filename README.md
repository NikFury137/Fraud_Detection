# 🕵️‍♂️ Fraud Detection

A machine learning-based fraud detection system designed to identify fraudulent transactions using various classification algorithms.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using supervised learning techniques. It includes:

- Data preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training  
- Model evaluation  

The goal is to accurately distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes transaction patterns and fraud distribution.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements multiple classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
- **Feature Importance**: Highlights key indicators contributing to fraudulent activity.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains transaction-level details with a target label indicating whether each transaction is fraudulent.

- **Features**:  
  - Transaction amount, time, location, etc.  
  - Derived features (if applicable)

- **Target Variable**:  
  - Binary label (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraudulent)
